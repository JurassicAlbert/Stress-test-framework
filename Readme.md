# Stress Test Framework

This repository contains various test suites for performance and functional testing using different tools:

- **Locust** for load/performance testing
- **Cypress** for end-to-end (E2E) browser tests
- **Playwright** for headless browser automation and E2E tests
- **Selenium** for browser-based functional tests

All tests can be executed headlessly (or with a UI, where applicable) and integrated into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins).
